				<p>Keeping meat as close as possible to its natural form is a Saag’s promise. We craft products with no added nitrates, preservatives or MSG to help maintain the integrity and natural flavor of the meat. True to our artisanal roots, all of our products are prepared in batches of 500 pounds or less. Our made-from-scratch approach to each recipe means that no seasonal blends or extracts are used in our products.</p>
